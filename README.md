# MonoGame_multi_texture_shader

A test-repo to showcase a strange behavior that may be a bug.



### Notes

* The repo should contain all the files necessary for compilation.
* I've tried this using the latest develop NuGet available (3.6.0.1518)
* The project is WindowsDX as is my game that I've encountered this behavior on.
* Maybe I've done all the shaders wrong with the exception of the 'new' shader which obviously works.

### Update

* I've updated the repo with a few bug-fixes and added another series of tests that contain an additive shader that fetches values from the textures in the 'normal' order (base-texture, then displacement-texture) since the theory was that that order matters somehow when MG assigns the textures to the samplers.
* Seems to make a difference when actually it really shouldn't...

### Update

* I have removed the MG nuget package to be able to switch between MG versions more conveniently and to try the develop version.
* Tried with MG 3.7.0.960 -> same results.
* Added



## Results

###### First column shows a successful output

###### Row 1 and 2 use a different shader than row 3

![results](https://github.com/UnterrainerInformatik/MonoGame_multi_texture_shader/blob/master/results/psilo1.png)

###### new

```hlsl
Texture2D FirstTexture;
SamplerState FirstSampler
{
    Texture = <FirstTexture>;
	MinFilter = Linear;
	MagFilter = Linear;
	MipFilter = Linear;
	AddressU = Wrap;
	AddressV = Wrap;
};
... second one is the same style; omitted for brevity...
```

###### register

```hlsl
sampler2D FirstSampler : register(s0);
sampler2D SecondSampler : register(s1);
```

###### mixed

First uses register notation. Second doesn't.

```hlsl
sampler2D FirstSampler : register(s0);

texture SecondTexture;
sampler SecondSampler = sampler_state
{
	Texture = <SecondTexture>;
};
```

###### mix switch

Second uses register notation. First doesn't.

```hlsl
sampler2D SecondSampler : register(s0);

texture FirstTexture;
sampler FirstSampler = sampler_state
{
	Texture = <FirstTexture>;
};
```

###### tex2d

```hlsl
texture FirstTexture;
sampler FirstSampler = sampler_state
{
	Texture = <FirstTexture>;
};

texture SecondTexture;
sampler SecondSampler = sampler_state
{
	Texture = <SecondTexture>;
};
```



#### Row1 and 2

The shader for those rows is a displacement shader. I take a value from the second map and use this value to look up the right, displaced, value in the base-map.

Therefore the fetching order here is 2 -> 1.

(The first column actually shows the successful output of the displacement shader. All columns should look like that.)

#### Row3

The shader for this row is a additive shader. I take a value from the first and the second map, divide them by two, add them and return that as the resulting color.

Therefore the fetching order here is 1 -> 2.

(The first (new), the third (mixed) and fifth (tex2D) columns actually show the successful output of the additive shader. All columns should look like that.)

### Test With OpenGL Project

![results](https://github.com/UnterrainerInformatik/MonoGame_multi_texture_shader/blob/master/results/psilo2.png)

The 'new' version of the declaration is not available at level 2_0 or 3_0, so it's MG-orange.

### Open Questions

* Why does my version of the 'set second texture directly through registers' not work. There has to be a coding mistake somewhere. I see it far to often in examples. I'm pretty sure that it worked sometime.
* Why does the tex2D-way not work with the displacement shader, but with the additive shader?
* Why does the mixed-way not work with the displacement shader, but with the additive shader?
* Mix-switched column:
  While it is obvious why the 'mixed_switched' shader code wouldn't work with the additive shader, why is it displaying something with the displacement shader at all.
  From the looks of it it's displacing the base-texture with the base-texture.
