# MonoGame_multi_texture_shader
A test-repo to showcase a strange behavior that may be a bug.



### Notes

The repo should contain all the files necessary for compilation.

I've tried this using the latest develop NuGet available (3.6.0.1518)

The project is WindowsDX as is my game that I've encountered this behavior on.

Maybe I've done all the shaders wrong with the exception of the 'new' shader which obviously works.
