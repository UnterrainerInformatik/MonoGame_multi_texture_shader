# MonoGame_multi_texture_shader
A test-repo to showcase a strange behavior that may be a bug.



### Notes

The repo should contain all the files necessary for compilation.

I've tried this using the latest develop NuGet available (3.6.0.1518)

The project is WindowsDX as is my game that I've encountered this behavior on.

Maybe I've done all the shaders wrong with the exception of the 'new' shader which obviously works.

### Update

I've updated the repo with a few bug-fixes and added another series of tests that contain an additive shader that fetches values from the textures in the 'normal' order (base-texture, then displacement-texture) since the theory was that that order matters somehow when MG assigns the textures to the samplers.

Seems to make a difference when actually it really shouldn't...

#### Row1 and 2

The shader for those rows is a displacement shader. I take a value from the second map and use this value to look up the right, displaced, value in the base-map.

Therefore the fetching order here is 2 -> 1.

#### Row3

The shader for this row is a additive shader. I take a value from the first and the second map, divide them by two, add them and return that as the resulting color.

### Open Questions

* Why does my version of the 'set second texture directly through registers' not work. There has to be a coding mistake somewhere. I see it far to often in examples. I'm pretty sure that it worked sometime.
